title: "OpenGL DISABLED Viz Desktop"
description: |
  WARNING: You may experience long wait times for an OpenGL disabled desktop. This app
  will launch an OpenGL disabled session on the Remote Visualization nodes for
  applications that require manual intervention to start in a Hardware Accelerated
  manner.  These applications should be started with "vglrun application"
  If you do not require hardware accelerated graphics, the UB-HPC desktop session
  will likely start much faster than this.  The longest allowable wall time for
  these nodes is 24 hours.  However, you can select less if desired and this
  will potentially  decrease your wait time.
