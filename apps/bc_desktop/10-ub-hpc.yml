title: "Academic Cluster (UB-HPC) Desktop"
description: This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes. You will have full access to the resources these nodes provide. This is analogous to an interactive batch job. The longest allowable wall time for these nodes is 72 hours (except the debug partition which is 1 hour). However, you can select less if desired and this will almost certainly decrease your wait time.
