  WARNING: You may experience long wait times for an OpenGL desktop. This app will launch an
  OpenGL enabled session on the Remote Visualization nodes.  If you do not require hardware
  accelerated graphics, the UB-HPC desktop session will likely start much faster than this.
  The longest allowable wall time for these nodes is 24 hours.  However, you can select
  less if desired and this will potentially  decrease your wait time.
