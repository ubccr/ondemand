title: "Academic Cluster Desktop - Advanced Options"
description: This app will launch an interactive desktop on one or more compute nodes in the academic (ub-hpc) cluster.  The longest allowable wall time for these nodes is 72 hours (except the debug partition which is 1 hour). It is recommended that you enter only the time you need to run your job rather than use the default.
